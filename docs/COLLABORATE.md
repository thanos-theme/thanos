# Collaboration Guide

## I want to submit a new theme ...

1. Create a new repository with the `technology` you've chosen to port thanos into, following the naming convention:

   ```
   technology-with-several-names
   ```

2. The name of the repository doesn't need to have `thanos` or `thanos-theme` within it's name.

3. You should base your repository on this [template](https://github.com/thanos-theme/theme-template) repo.

4. Follow the documentation for your chosen technology and create the theme using our [color guide](https://github.com/thanos-theme/thanos#colors) (remember to check the color types).

5. Now you only need to submit your newly created theme through a [new issue](https://github.com/thanos-theme/thanos/issues/new) inside our [main repository](https://github.com/thanos-theme/thanos).

6. Once your issue was reviewed our [galactic contributors](https://github.com/thanos-theme/thanos/graphs/contributors) will move it to a dedicated repo under [thanos-theme](https://github.com/thanos-theme) with you added as the `galactic maintainer` of that theme.

## I want to improve an existing theme ...

1. Create a new issue under that theme repo. **Don't do that under the [main repository](https://github.com/thanos-theme/thanos) or the [homepage repo](https://github.com/thanos-theme/.github)!!**

2. Once the issue were selected and reviewed the code will be added to the next release.

## I want to be in touch with the creator ...

You can do that through the [official e-mail](mailto:thanos@arthur404.dev?subject=[GitHub%20-%20thanos-theme]%20YOUR_SUBJECT_HERE).
